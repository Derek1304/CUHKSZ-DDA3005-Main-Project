Introduction

Causal feature learning is a special caual learning method, as a causal inference framework rooted in
the language of causal graphical models in 2009. The goal of causal feature learning is to discover
high-level causal relations from low-level data, and at reducing the experimental effort to understand
confounding among the high-level variables. The focus of this project will be implementing existing
causal feature learning algorithms and developing new causal models to adapt causal feature learning
to more applications with confounders and high-dimensional data.
